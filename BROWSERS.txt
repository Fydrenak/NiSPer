It is important that the browser is up-to-date, as this software uses many modern features of browsers for some of its features.


Firefox
---------------------------------------
Simply open the HTML file in Firefox and everything should run smoothly.

Chrome
---------------------------------------
Due to Chrome's security policy, this software will not run on Chrome by simply opening the html file. It must be started in a local webserver. If you have python 3 installed, running 'python -m http.server' from this directory will enable the local use of this software.

Edge or Internet Explorer
---------------------------------------
Internet explorer is no longer supported even by Microsoft, so this software will definitely not run. Edge is lacking some key features of modern browsers that enable this software to run, but they may be added at some point. Please try and avoid these browsers in general, and especially when using NiSPer.
